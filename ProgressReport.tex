Course on C\texttt{++} is finished. \\
Text has had a revision, I have now a better idea what to write. But it is far from finished. I also tried to create a red-line in the story. \\
Last Monday evening an error popped up on the  C\texttt{++} model, which I would like to discuss. I have tried resolving it, but could not manage.
