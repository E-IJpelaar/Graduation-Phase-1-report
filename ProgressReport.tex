\subsection*{Progress Week 28-8 till 3-09 }


\begin{itemize}
    \item Adapted the text with the comments you send me
    \item Change planning, there was a mistake regarding its duration (8 months+2 weeks holiday). Begin/end date have been rescheduled and 2 weeks were added, so some tasks could be spread more
    \item TODO: added extra figures
    \item Changed the code to work with a single link, see section "Comments" for further remarks/questions
    \item TODO: Made simulation in Matlab for the single link with gripper
\end{itemize}j




\subsection*{Comments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item NDisc = 1 only works with NMode = 2. It is possible to increase NMode? I get an error message in DenseBase.h: "rows == this$\xrightarrow[]{}$rows\(\) \&\& cols == this$\xrightarrow[]{}$ cols\(\) \&\& "DenseBase::resize\(\) does not actually allow to resize.". I could not figure it out how this could be resolved.
    \item For qd = [1 1] the actual q can only be controlled to [1 0.38]. Is this a logical consequence of the model (shapefunction)? Or has it to do with the controller?


\end{itemize}
