Recent developments in control of soft robots have manly put its focus on kinematic, model-free or a combination of both. Ther


With this master thesis, 


\textit{Design, develop and optimize a model based control strategy for a multi-link soft robot to perform a reference tracking problem}









\todo{here the different control techniques applied to classic under-actuated systems need to be described and should briefly related to our system}

\hl{Papers to talk about:}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Energy based control of a class of under-actuated systems \cite{spong1996energy}
    \item Partial feedback linearization of under-actuated mechanical systems \cite{spong1994linear}
    \item Sliding mode control of a class of under-actuated systems \cite{xu2008sliding}
    \item Hybrid Control for a Class of under-actuated Mechanical Systems \cite{fierro1999hybrid}. Used computed torque control
    \item Control of under-actuated robot manipulators using switching
    computed torque method: GA based approach \cite{udawatta2003control}.  Possibility to change the GA based approach with a fuzzy logic controller \cite{udawatta2003controlfuzzy}
    \item Survey presents the current control strategies for under-actuated systems \cite{liu2013survey} : Partial feedback linearisation, Energy-based methods, Sliding mode control, Fuzzy control, and Optimal control (energy-optimal and time-optimal optimisation)
